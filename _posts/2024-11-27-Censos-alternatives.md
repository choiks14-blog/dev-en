Introduction.


A census is an important national survey that collects basic statistical data on the size, distribution, structure, and household characteristics of a country's population. Governments use this data to formulate various national policies, such as education, housing, healthcare, employment, and social welfare, and to allocate budgets and resources efficiently. As such, censuses play a vital role as essential basic data for national development planning and resource utilization.

In Korea, the first national census was conducted in 1925 and has been conducted regularly every five years since then. Initially, the census simply captured the number of people and basic population structure, but over time, the survey items have been gradually expanded to produce a variety of demographic data, including household characteristics, economic activity, and education level. More recently, the Census of Population and Housing was conducted in 2015 and 2020 to collect housing-related statistics.

In this report, we will first analyze the problems of the current census system, then explore various options to supplement or replace it, including the use of administrative data, big data analysis, and sample surveys, and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and cost. Finally, we will synthesize our findings and suggest a desirable direction for future census production.

Problems with the current census system - time-consuming and costly
----------------------------

The current census system is extremely time-consuming and costly because it involves sending thousands of surveyors to households across the country. In the case of the 2020 Census, about 110,000 enumerators were employed and the survey period lasted four months. This large-scale mobilization of manpower to conduct a full enumeration over a long period of time resulted in an excessive budget. It is estimated that the government budgeted about KRW 320 billion for the 2020 census, with a significant portion of this amount going to fieldwork activities such as surveyor labor, transportation, and accommodation.

The preparation and post-processing of the survey is also costly. In particular, there are many difficulties in training and managing investigators because a large number of people need to be mobilized in a short period of time, which requires additional costs for recruitment, training, and deployment of investigators, as well as costs for inputting and computer processing of survey data.

Furthermore, during the survey period, there are indirect social costs such as disruption of production activities and traffic congestion. Residents' lives are also inconvenienced by surveyors visiting households. As such, the traditional field survey method is causing many inefficiencies in terms of time and cost, and there is an urgent need for new ways to improve it.

Problems with the Current Census System - Privacy Issues
----------------------------

Another major problem with the current census system is the risks associated with privacy. The census collects a large amount of highly sensitive personal information about each person in a household, including their name, date of birth, address, occupation, income, and health status. If this information were to be leaked, it would severely compromise individuals' privacy and expose them to financial harm and even criminalization.

In fact, during the 2015 Census, there was a data breach in some census tracts. A surveyor lost a laptop containing household information, exposing the personal data of hundreds of people. The incident raised public anxiety about privacy breaches and significantly reduced trust in the census system as a whole. The government has put in place measures to prevent a recurrence and increased security training, but many people are still concerned about the risk of personal data breaches.

The risk of privacy breaches inherent in such a large-scale household survey is a fundamental problem with the census system. The impact of a data breach is not just an invasion of privacy, but can lead to secondary crimes such as identity theft and financial fraud, which can be very costly. In fact, there have been cases of secondary crimes, such as financial fraud, in which some affected residents have been victims of financial fraud after a personal information leak. Therefore, it is essential to thoroughly prepare privacy protection measures when exploring new demographic production methods in the future.

Problems with the current census system - Accuracy issues
------------------------

The current census system has significant problems with accuracy. This is because the process of collecting massive amounts of data from millions of households across the country is bound to introduce a variety of errors.

First of all, there is the problem of mistakes and misrecordings due to human error or carelessness. Repeating the same tasks over and over again for long periods of time can lead to distractions and misrecorded surveys. During the 2015 Census, misrecording rates of more than 10% were observed in some districts.

Inaccuracies due to memory lapses or intentional false responses by respondents are also a problem. People often hide or underreport sensitive information about their income or wealth. In fact, comparing past survey results with administrative data such as the Internal Revenue Service has shown significant discrepancies.

In addition, missing or duplicate surveys are common due to migration, household fragmentation, and more. The inaccuracy of survey data due to these issues can lead to serious distortions in the formulation of key national policies and the allocation of resources.

For example, the absence of accurate income statistics can lead to errors in targeting welfare policies. In addition, the lack of an accurate picture of population distribution and age structure by region will disrupt planning for the provision of public services such as education, healthcare, and housing. Inaccurate demographics will also have a negative impact on overall national development plans.

Therefore, in the future, it will be necessary to improve accuracy by supplementing field surveys or introducing new methods of statistical production. It is essential to secure accurate demographics through measures such as linking administrative data and analyzing big data.

Alternatives to the census - using administrative data
---------------------

One alternative to the census is the use of administrative data. Administrative data refers to administrative information that government agencies or public organizations collect in the course of their work. Examples include social security data, health insurance enrollment, real estate transactions, and vehicle registration information.

Collectively, these data can be used to produce more efficient and accurate demographics than traditional census methods. Since administrative data is already collected in the course of an organization's work, it doesn't require a large survey cost, and since the data is already computerized, the follow-up process will be very efficient.

Administrative data is also highly accurate because it is an official record. It is expected to contain more accurate information than surveys that rely on people's recollections. In addition, data linkage between government agencies can produce more comprehensive demographics.

However, administrative data alone can be a poor substitute for the richness of information provided by traditional censuses. This is because there may be items that are not included in administrative data, so it is necessary to use complementary methods such as surveys and big data analytics alongside administrative data.

Alternatives to the census - using big data analytics
-----------------------

Big data analytics is gaining attention as a new alternative to the census. Big data refers to structured or unstructured data that is so large that it is difficult to collect, store, manage, and analyze with traditional database management tools. Examples include social media and website log data, location information, and sensor data.

Analyzing this big data with artificial intelligence techniques can help you understand the demographic characteristics of individuals and households. For example, by analyzing social media posts, search queries, and purchase history, you can infer a person's age, occupation, income level, household characteristics, and more. Cell tower location data and transportation card data can also be used to track population movement and distribution in real time.

The biggest advantage of big data analytics is the ability to collect and process large amounts of data in real time at low cost. It's more cost-effective than traditional surveys, enables timely analysis of population trends, and eliminates sampling error by utilizing the entire population rather than a sample.

However, big data analytics has its limitations. Bias in the data collection process can compromise representativeness and accuracy. For example, social media data may be underrepresented among older and lower-income populations. There are also privacy concerns and a shortage of analytics talent.

Therefore, big data analytics should be used in parallel and complementary to other methods, such as administrative data and sample surveys. While big data is gaining attention as a new alternative to overcome the limitations of traditional censuses, it still faces a number of challenges.

Evaluate alternatives
--------

Alternatives to the census, such as using administrative data, big data analytics, and sample surveys, all have advantages and disadvantages. Here's how we evaluate each of these options in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and cost.

First, using administrative data is considered to be the most accurate. Because the data is officially collected by government agencies, it is less likely to be subject to individual memory lapses or false responses. In addition, data can be linked across government agencies to produce comprehensive demographics. From a cost perspective, it is also very efficient because it utilizes existing administrative information without the need for additional research. However, there are limitations to using administrative data alone, as some demographic information is difficult to obtain.

Big data analysis methods are cost-effective because they can collect and process large amounts of data in real time at a low cost. They can also eliminate sampling error because they utilize the entire population rather than a sample. However, accuracy issues can arise due to bias in the data collection process, and privacy concerns and lack of specialized manpower also remain a challenge.

While sample surveys are relatively more efficient and cost-effective than census surveys, they still require significant labor and expense. Accuracy is also subject to bias depending on the sample design and sampling methodology.

As each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages, it would be desirable to utilize them complementarily: administrative data to collect timely and relevant secondary information from big data, and sample surveys to fill in the gaps that administrative data and big data do not capture. The organic combination of these various methods is expected to increase both efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion.
--.

We've discussed the importance of census, the problems with the current census system, and the pros and cons of various alternatives. Traditional field surveys are time-consuming and costly, with privacy risks and accuracy issues. Alternatives include the use of administrative data, big data analytics, and sample surveys, but they have their limitations and need to be used complementarily.

As you can see, the current census system has a number of structural problems that need to be addressed. Inaccurate and inefficient demographics will inevitably lead to major distortions in national policy formulation and resource allocation. The provision of public services such as education, health, and housing will also be disrupted. Therefore, improving the census to produce accurate and efficient demographics is essential for national development.

To do this, we must first strengthen the administrative data linkage system. Data integration and standardization across government departments will enable comprehensive and accurate demographic statistics. Second, we must continue to invest in advancing big data analytics technology. Big data-driven census production will provide timely information at a lower cost. Third, sample surveys should be utilized as a complementary method to meet demographic needs. Sample surveys can fill in the gaps that administrative data and big data cannot capture. Finally, we need to address public anxiety by thoroughly preparing privacy measures.

Going forward, the government should comprehensively implement these measures to build a new census system that meets the needs of the 21st century information age. By doing so, it is expected that Korea will be able to have an accurate and efficient demographic system at the level of advanced countries.
