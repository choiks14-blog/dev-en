Introduction.


A Vector Database is a database system that stores and manages text data by converting it into high-dimensional vectors. This enables fast and accurate information retrieval from large amounts of data.

The key concepts of a vector database are as follows: First, text is converted and stored as high-dimensional vectors. This allows you to leverage the semantic associations in your data. Second, it enables efficient and accurate searching by calculating similarities between vectors. It provides better results than traditional text-based search. Third, you can quickly retrieve relevant information from large amounts of data.

These characteristics make vector databases a very important technology for large-scale language models, especially in search engines, recommender systems, and natural language processing. Wherever efficient and accurate information retrieval from large amounts of textual data is required, vector databases can play a key role .

How vector databases work - vector representation of data
--------------------------------

In a vector database, text data is converted and stored as high-dimensional vectors. This process is accomplished in two main steps: "chunking" and "embedding".

In the chunking phase, the original text is divided into smaller chunks of a certain size, and each chunk is converted into a high-dimensional vector in the embedding phase. We utilize natural language processing models to create a vector representation that reflects the meaning and context of the text.

Representing text data as vectors has several advantages. First, it allows you to calculate the similarity between two vectors in a vector space. This allows you to effectively search for semantically related data. Second, the efficiency of high-dimensional vector operations allows for fast searching even on large amounts of data. Third, it can better reflect the semantic context of the text to provide accurate search results.

As a result, representing textual data as vectors is a critical step toward efficient and accurate data retrieval. By providing these capabilities, vector databases are playing a key role in large-scale language models and many natural language processing tasks.

How Vector Databases Work - Similarity-based Search
----------------------------

Vector databases use similarity-based search. The process goes like this

1. the user's query text is divided into chunks and represented as a high-dimensional vector through a vector embedding process. This is the same way stored data is vectorized.
    
2. A similarity score between the query vector and all stored vectors is calculated. Typically, a similarity measure such as cosine similarity is used. This determines semantic similarity by calculating the cosine value of the angle between two vectors.
    
3. For efficient search, the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithm and indexing techniques are utilized. This enables fast similarity search even in large vector databases.
    
4. The most similar vectors and their corresponding text chunks are returned as search results.
    

This similarity-based search has the following advantages over traditional keyword-based search.

First, it takes into account the semantic context of the text, so it can provide more relevant results by reflecting synonyms, similar expressions, context, etc. This is because it is based on semantic similarity, not just keyword matches.

Second, it can find semantically related information even if there is no keyword overlap at all. This can be useful in a variety of natural language processing tasks, including question and answer and recommendation systems.

Third, it utilizes efficient vector operations to enable fast search even on large amounts of data. This can help fulfill real-time search requirements.

How Vector Databases Work - Dimensionality Reduction and Encoding Techniques
--------------------------------

Dimensionality reduction and encoding techniques are the key technologies that enable fast and accurate search in vector databases. They play an important role in meeting real-time search requirements, especially on large datasets.

Dimensionality reduction is a technique that compresses high-dimensional vectors into low-dimensional vectors, which can reduce data size to save storage space and computational costs. It also improves data quality by removing noise. Typical dimensionality reduction techniques include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), etc.

Encoding techniques are used to compress vector data for storage and retrieval. For example, techniques such as Product Quantization (PQ) and Optimized Product Quantization (OPQ) can compress large vectors into smaller codes. This compressed code can significantly reduce storage space and retrieval time.

These techniques allow you to efficiently process large amounts of high-dimensional vector data. By reducing the size of the data, you can speed up search and improve accuracy by removing noise. Dimensionality reduction and encoding techniques are therefore key enablers of real-time search on large datasets.

This allows you to leverage data from user profiles, product information, reviews, and more to provide personalized recommendations.

For example, e-commerce recommendation systems store data such as product descriptions, images, and reviews by converting them into vectors, and then search for similar vectors based on a user's purchase history, search queries, interests, and more to recommend related products. This results in more accurate and personalized recommendations because they are based on semantic similarity rather than simple keyword matching.

In addition, the vector database can retrieve relevant information in real time, even from large amounts of data, providing fast response times. This greatly improves the user experience. What's more, the ability to integrate multiple data sources - not just text, but images, audio, and more - allows you to leverage multiple dimensions of information for more sophisticated recommendations.

In this way, vector databases can provide efficient and accurate similarity search, which can increase the performance and personalization of recommendation systems. This is why vector databases have recently become an important technology in the development of recommendation systems.

Vector Database Use Case - Multimedia Search
--------------------------

Vector databases are heavily utilized in the field of multimedia data retrieval. This is because they can represent various multimedia data such as images, audio, video, etc. as vectors, not just text. This makes it possible to retrieve semantically related information from text queries or multimedia data entered by users.

For example, in image search, embedding images as vectors is an effective way to find similar images. When a user uploads an image, you can search your vector database for similar vectors and provide related image results. This provides more accurate and meaningful results than a simple keyword-based search.

Vector databases can also support multimodal search by integrating different data types, such as text, images, and audio. For example, if a user enters the text query "pictures of puppies," both image and text information related to puppies can be retrieved and served. By utilizing multimodal data in this way, you can provide richer, more contextual information.

Vector databases also have the advantage of being able to perform real-time search on large datasets. Efficient indexing and nearest neighbor algorithms can be leveraged to provide fast search speeds. This is crucial when dealing with large amounts of multimedia data.

Vector Database Use Cases - Natural Language Processing
------------------------

Vector databases are widely used in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially in Question Answering systems and Text Summarization tasks.

In a question answering system, the documents in the knowledge base are represented as vectors and stored in a vector database. When a user's question is entered, the question text is converted to a vector and the similarity to the vectors of the knowledge base documents is calculated. The document chunks corresponding to the top vectors with the highest similarity can be retrieved to generate answers. In this case, the vector database can retrieve relevant information in real time, even from large datasets, which can significantly increase the performance of the QA system.

Vector databases are also used in text summarization. By dividing the original text into small chunks and embedding each chunk as a vector, a representative vector can be selected by computing the similarity between the vectors, and the chunks associated with that vector can be used as summaries. By utilizing similarity between vectors, you can remove redundancy and generate a high-quality summary that includes key points.

Vector databases are also being utilized in a variety of other natural language processing tasks, including chatbots, document classification, sentiment analysis, and more. By representing textual data as vectors, semantic similarities can be calculated and fast searches can be performed on large amounts of data. By providing these capabilities, vector databases can significantly increase the performance and accuracy of natural language processing models.
