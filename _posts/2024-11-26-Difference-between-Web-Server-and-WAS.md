Introduction.


Web servers (Web servers) and Web application servers (WAS) play a key role in building and delivering Web applications. A Web server is a program that processes requests from clients based on the HTTP protocol to serve static content (.html, .jpeg, .css, etc.). A WAS, on the other hand, is responsible for generating dynamic content, processing requests from clients and delivering the results to the web server. WAS runs and manages web applications such as Servlets.

A web application consists of static and dynamic content. The web server and WAS are responsible for static and dynamic content, respectively, enabling efficient web application deployment. The division of labor between the Web server and WAS reduces server load, improves security, and enables you to serve multiple Web applications simultaneously.

In this chapter, we will discuss in detail the functions and differences between Web servers and WAS, as well as examples of their application in real-world Web service structures. Understanding the roles of Web servers and WAS will enable efficient Web application development and operation.

What a web server and WAS do - Describing the role and functionality of a web server
-------------------------------

A web server (Web Server) plays the main role of processing requests from clients and serving static content based on the HTTP protocol. Static content refers to resources that do not change, such as images, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

When a web server receives a request from a client, it immediately delivers the requested static files. By bypassing the Web Application Server (WAS) and serving static files directly, you can reduce the load on the WAS.

Web applications have both static and dynamic content. By having the web server handle static content, the WAS can focus on generating dynamic content, such as database lookups and processing business logic. If the web server does not serve static content, the WAS must serve all requests, which can increase load and slow response times.

Therefore, the web server plays an important role in serving static content quickly, reducing the load on the WAS and improving the performance of the entire web application.

What Web Servers and WAS Do - Explaining the Role and Function of WAS
------------------------------

A Web Application Server (WAS) is an application server created to serve dynamic content. It acts as middleware to perform applications to clients over the HTTP protocol.

The primary role of a WAS is to run web applications and generate dynamic pages. It uses technologies such as servlets and JSPs to process requests from clients and deliver the results to the web server. To do this, WAS provides a software engine, sometimes called a "web container" or "servlet container," that can run JSPs and servlets.

WAS performs tasks such as database lookups, business logic processing, and transaction management. It receives requests from clients, fetches the required data from the database, processes that data to generate dynamic pages, manages multiple logical units of work (transactions), and executes business logic to accomplish tasks.

In this way, unlike a web server, a WAS is responsible for dynamic content creation and application execution, not just static file delivery. By separating the web server and WAS, you can reduce server load, improve security, and serve multiple web applications simultaneously.

Functions of web servers and WAS - A comparison of the key differences between web servers and WAS
------------------------------------

Web servers and WAS fulfill different roles in building web applications. The main difference is that a web server handles static content and a WAS handles dynamic content.

Web servers take requests from clients based on the HTTP protocol and serve static files such as HTML, CSS, and images. A WAS, on the other hand, uses technologies like JSP and Servlet to perform dynamic tasks, such as database lookups or processing business logic, and passes the results back to the web server.

In this way, the web server and WAS share different roles to increase the performance of your web application. The web server reduces the load on the WAS by serving static content quickly, allowing the WAS to focus on generating dynamic content. This separation of roles allows for efficient utilization of server resources.

The web server is also responsible for SSL encryption, authentication, load balancing, and failover. Meanwhile, the WAS provides functions such as transaction management, messaging processing, and more. This division of labor between the web server and WAS increases the reliability and efficiency of your web application as a whole.

Use cases for web servers and WAS - Web server alone use case
--------------------------------

Because web servers are responsible for serving static content quickly, they can be used alone in the following cases

1. hosting static web pages or websites
    
    * For static web pages or websites that consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, a web server is sufficient to serve them.
2. serving static resources such as images, videos, etc.
    
    * Web servers can quickly serve static resources such as images, videos, PDF files, etc. Therefore, only web servers can be used in image hosting services, video streaming services, etc.
3. Small web application services
    
    * For small web applications with little dynamic content and not much server load, a web server alone may be sufficient for service. However, if dynamic content is added or traffic increases, a WAS should be used in conjunction.

For services that serve simple static content, a web server is sufficient, but for web applications with a lot of dynamic content or heavy load, it is common to use a combination of a web server and WAS.

Use cases for a web server and WAS - WAS alone
-------------------------------

A Web Application Server (WAS) is responsible for generating and serving dynamic web content. Therefore, if your web application consists mostly of dynamic content and very little static content, you can use a WAS by itself.

The main benefit of using WAS alone is that it simplifies the architecture and reduces the burden of managing the web server. It also eliminates communication between the web server and WAS, which can improve performance by eliminating communication overhead.

Examples of WAS-only architectures include RESTful API servers or microservice architectures. These primarily send and receive data in the form of JSON or XML, and their primary function is to generate dynamic content. Because they rarely have static content, they can be served by WAS alone.

However, if there is some static content, the WAS must also handle static content, which can increase the load. In addition, it is difficult to provide features such as load balancing and failover in a WAS-only structure, so it is difficult to ensure high availability. Therefore, you should choose an appropriate structure based on the characteristics and requirements of your web application.

Use Cases for Web Server and WAS - Use Cases for Web Server and WAS Together
----------------------------------------

The most common case for using a web server and WAS together is most web applications. Because web applications consist of both static and dynamic content, the web server and WAS can serve them efficiently by dividing their respective roles.

The web server is responsible for quickly serving static content such as HTML, CSS, and images, while the WAS generates dynamic content by performing dynamic tasks such as database lookups and processing business logic. By separating these roles, the web server and WAS can reduce the load on each other and increase the performance and reliability of the entire web application.

A typical example is a shopping mall website. A shopping mall has both static content, such as product categories and detail pages, and dynamic content, such as shopping carts and order processing. The web server is responsible for serving the static pages quickly, while the WAS is responsible for processing the user's order information and storing it in a database.

Separating the web server and WAS also has security and scalability benefits. You can perform SSL encryption processing on the web server and connect multiple WAS to balance the load, especially for large web applications. Separating the web server and WAS makes it easier to operate uninterrupted and overcome failures.

Bottom line.
--.

Web servers and web application servers (WAS) are responsible for handling static and dynamic content, respectively. The web server quickly serves static resources such as HTML, CSS, and images to lighten the load on the WAS, while the WAS generates dynamic pages by looking up databases, processing business logic, and more. This division of labor helps increase the performance and reliability of your web application.

It's important to choose the right configuration for your web server and WAS. If you have a high proportion of static content, you should emphasize the web server role, and if you have a high proportion of dynamic content, you should emphasize the WAS role. Separating the web server and WAS also improves security and scalability by reducing server load and enabling features such as SSL encryption processing and load balancing. Especially for large web applications, separating the web server and WAS is beneficial for failover for uninterrupted operation.

In the future, the role of web servers and WAS is expected to become even more important in cloud computing environments. Architectural advancements such as distributed deployment and load balancing of web servers and WAS to increase scalability and availability are expected. In addition, advancements in container technology will make deployment and management of web servers and WAS easier.
