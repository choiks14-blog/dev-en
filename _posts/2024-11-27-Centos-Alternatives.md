Introduction.


CentOS is a derivative distribution based on the source code of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). However, its different delivery method from RHEL has resulted in differences in the timing of updates and patches, the amount of community contributions, and so on, which has resulted in a lack of certainty and stability.

Meanwhile, in 2019, Red Hat proposed the CentOS Stream project as a replacement for CentOS Linux. CentOS Stream is an upstream development version of RHEL that serves to integrate and test new features and technologies in advance of the next RHEL version. As such, CentOS Stream was not suitable for use in production environments.

As a result, official support for legacy CentOS Linux 7 ended on June 30, 2024, and updates and releases from the CentOS project ceased, leaving CentOS Linux users exposed to unpatched vulnerabilities and potential security risks. This situation has created a need for existing CentOS users to explore alternative distributions where they can receive stable and ongoing support.

RedHat Enterprise Linux
-----------------------

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is an enterprise-class Linux distribution developed by Red Hat. RHEL is based on more than 25 years of experience with the open source development model and serves as the core of Red Hat's integrated portfolio and solutions.

Key benefits of RHEL include

* Stable, proven operating system optimized for production environments
* Enterprise-grade support services to deliver rapid patches and updates
* Certified compatibility with a broad partner ecosystem
* Security certifications and compliance support to ensure operational stability
* Contributions to open source communities for new technology adoption and innovation

On the other hand, RHEL has a paid subscription model, which comes at a cost.

Historically, CentOS was a free distribution based on RHEL's source code, so migrating to RHEL has the advantage of allowing CentOS users to work in a familiar environment. RHEL also has advantages over CentOS in terms of long-term support, security, and stability. Red Hat offers a competitive transition program for CentOS Linux users to ease the transition from CentOS to RHEL.

Therefore, CentOS users may want to consider RHEL as an alternative if they value stability and long-term support, especially in enterprise environments.

Rocky Linux
-----------

Rocky Linux is an open-source enterprise Linux distribution launched in late 2020 due to the closure of the CentOS project. Rocky Linux redistributes the source code of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and, like CentOS before it, is community-driven.

The main advantages of Rocky Linux are that it offers a similar user experience to CentOS, making it easier for existing users to migrate. It is also a completely open source project, meaning that anyone can contribute to its development. However, because it is community-driven, it can be difficult to ensure long-term support and stability.

Rocky Linux, on the other hand, has the advantage of being free to use, unlike Red Hat's commercial product, RHEL. However, the lack of commercial support can limit its use in enterprise environments.

In conclusion, Rocky Linux can be considered as an alternative option to CentOS because it provides a familiar environment for CentOS users, making it easier to migrate. However, for enterprise environments that value long-term support and stability, Red Hat Enterprise Linux is likely a better fit.

AlmaLinux
---------

AlmaLinux is an open source enterprise Linux distribution that was started in late 2020, shortly after the CentOS project ended. Like CentOS, it operates as a redistribution of the source code of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

The main advantage of AlmaLinux is that it provides a very similar user experience to CentOS, making it easy for existing CentOS users to migrate. It is also free to use and is community-driven, meaning that anyone can contribute to it.

However, as a community-driven project, it can be difficult to ensure long-term support and stability. It also lacks commercial support, which can limit its use in enterprise environments.

In conclusion, AlmaLinux can be considered as an alternative to CentOS because it provides a familiar environment for CentOS users, making it easier to migrate. However, for enterprise environments that value long-term support and stability, Red Hat Enterprise Linux is likely a better fit .

Other options
-----

Ubuntu and Debian are two popular Linux distributions that you can consider instead of CentOS. Both distributions are free and run as open source projects.

Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian and is widely used in both desktop and server environments. It has a user-friendly interface and easy installation process, and new versions are released every six months to keep you up to date with the latest technologies. However, the short release cycle makes long-term support difficult, and the lack of commercial support is a drawback .

Debian is the upstream source of Ubuntu and is a very stable and secure distribution. Due to its strict package management policies, it may not have the latest versions of packages, but it is widely used in server environments where reliability is important. Disadvantages include being tricky to install and set up, and not very user-friendly in a desktop environment.

Ubuntu and Debian are not part of the Red Hat family, unlike CentOS, so migration may require changes to applications and processes. They may also lack the level of long-term and commercial support required in an enterprise environment. However, as a free, open-source distribution, they can be cost-effective, and if you need stability in a server environment, Debian is a good alternative.

Conclusion.
--.

With the discontinuation of the CentOS distribution, a number of alternative options have emerged. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) has been touted for its stability and long-term support, but its paid subscription model makes it costly. Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux are free to use and offer a similar experience to CentOS, but their community-driven development can make it difficult to ensure long-term support and stability. Ubuntu and Debian are also free and open-source distributions, but they have a different foundation than CentOS and can be subject to many changes when migrating.

In conclusion, the best distro for a CentOS replacement option will depend on your enterprise environment: if long-term support and stability are important to you, RHEL will be the best fit, and if cost savings is your goal, you might consider Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux. Debian is also an alternative if you need stability in a server environment. In the future, Linux distributions are expected to evolve in the direction of integration with cloud-native technologies, support for containers and virtualization, and increased security. Users will need to choose a distribution that fits their needs and business goals, and develop a migration plan that takes into account their long-term roadmap.
